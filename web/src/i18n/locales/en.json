Monitor 'Unassigned: N' and 'At risk: M' counters. Delay orders (+5/+10 min), mark manual assignments, delete trips. Drivers List: View all drivers with sequential IDs, filter by car type (Sedan/Minivan/SUV), location status (on map/offline), edit Driver ID and Car ID, delete drivers with confirmation. Calendar: Plan orders by day/week, view conflicts, see driver schedules. Clients: Add clients with phone/name, view address history with categories, create orders from client profiles. Phone Database: Manage transferred numbers (old → new mappings). Pending Drivers: Approve or reject new driver registrations. Zones: View service area polygons on map (interactive, clickable).

GPS Tracking: Share location ('Go online') so dispatchers see you in real time with smooth marker animation (1s smoothing). Your marker shows car icon or arrow (rotates with heading), displays speed in mph, standing timer ('here for X min'), and heading direction ('To pickup', 'To dropoff'). Navigation: View route on map with turn-by-turn instructions, alternative routes with traffic info, distance and ETA. Use Google Maps/Waze for external navigation. Reports: Post real-time reports on map (Police, Traffic, Work Zone, Car Crash) - auto-expire after 1 minute. Translation: Voice-to-text and history for multilingual support.

Phone Database: Manage transferred phone numbers (old → new mappings) for seamless client transitions. Zones: Create and manage service area polygons (geofencing) with custom colors, view on map. Pending Drivers: Approve or reject new driver registrations. Cost Control: View API usage and limits (maps, translation, AI, TTS), receive alerts when limits are exceeded.
