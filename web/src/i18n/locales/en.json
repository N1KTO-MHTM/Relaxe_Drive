Wait timer with billing (first 5 min free). Map shows your location and route; share location so the dispatcher sees you in real time. Translation: voice-to-text and history for multilingual support.

Calendar: plan orders by day/week, see conflicts. Clients: add and search clients by phone/name, export CSV, create a new order from a client with one click. Translation and Analytics for operational support. Session monitor: see who is online (device, IP, last active). You control the full order and driver workflow.",
